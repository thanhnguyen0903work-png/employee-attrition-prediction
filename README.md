# Employee Attrition Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyses employee attrition using HR data to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and support data-driven workforce and retention decisions.

## Business Problem
High employee turnover can lead to increased recruitment costs, productivity loss, and operational disruption.  
This project aims to understand *why employees leave* and which factors contribute most to attrition.

## Dataset
- HR employee dataset (anonymised, academic use)
- Features include demographics, job role, compensation, work conditions, and performance-related variables

## Analytical Process
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analysis of key attrition drivers
- Insight interpretation from a business perspective

## Key Insights
- Attrition patterns vary significantly by job role, overtime, and compensation levels
- Employees with higher workload and lower job satisfaction show higher turnover risk
- Clear behavioural and structural drivers of attrition were identified

## Business Recommendations
- Improve workload balance and overtime management
- Review compensation and career progression for high-risk roles
- Use data-driven monitoring to proactively manage retention risks

## Tools & Skills
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- HR / People Analytics
- Business Insight Translation

## Outcome
The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow and provides actionable insights that can support HR strategy, workforce planning, and employee retention initiatives.
